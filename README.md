# Recipe Box

This is a small beginner project I made using React as a FreeCodeCamp requirement.

### What does it do?

It allows users to create recipes with a name and array of ingredients separated by commas, as well as giving them to ability to edit and delete existing recipes.

#### What else do I have to know?
This project was created with Stephen Grider's ReduxSimpleStarter as a base - see LICENSE.md for details.
The visual layout is fairly basic, as my purpose with this project was to working with state on a more difficult level and figuring out problems like:
How can I edit and delete a recipe when there's no instance of it like you'd have with a database? How do I get the reducer to return a new instance of state with only a specific recipe being edited or deleted?
