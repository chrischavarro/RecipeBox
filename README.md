# Recipe Box

This is a small beginner project I made using React as a FreeCodeCamp requirement.

### What does it do?

It allows users to create recipes with a name and array of ingredients separated by commas, as well as giving them to ability to edit and delete existing recipes

#### What else do I have to know?
This project was created with Stephen Grider's ReduxSimpleStarter as a base - see LICENSE.md for details.
